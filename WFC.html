            <p class="beginning">Every year when national parks and other nature centers get visitors, animal-related injuries occur. 
    This should be expected when people are placed in proximity of potentially dangerous animals, but there's more to it. 
    In Yellowstone National Park, for example, 80% of the animal-related injuries were a result of the people having approached the animal.
 An animal can hardly be expected to accept us crowding it, the responcibility lies with the visitors to take proper safety precautions.</p>

        <div class="column1"><p class="beginning">National Parks have a multitude of signs and warnings to attempt to keep people from approaching wild animals. 
            However, these efforts haven't been enought to completely stop people from crowding the wildlife. There are still a multitude of people each year
            that get close to the animals for photos, the experience, or in some cases even the thrill of the danger. While the relatively calm creatures
            give plenty of warning and allow many of these intruders to pass on by, the ones that push it too far end up badly injured or worse.
            As mentioned above, 4/5 animal related injuries in Yellowstone national park result from the person purposefully approaching the animal.
            Though it may be impossible to stop everybody from risking themselves, there must be more options to protect people while preserving the barrier-free
            connection to nature the parks enjoy.</p>

    <p>The most important part of this is the people. We need to spread the word of how dangerous nature can be to maintain these parks and protect the people that visit them,
         and the best way to do this involves you. We need your help to educate everybody, so you can offer ideas and suggestions through
        the form above or click on the links for donating and volunteering to our organization above.
